## üìå SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching All Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM branch_data;
SELECT * FROM service_data;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Region
```sql
SELECT branch_data.region, ROUND(SUM(service_data.total_revenue), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM service_data
JOIN branch_data ON service_data.branch_id = branch_data.branch_id
GROUP BY branch_data.region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Department
```sql
SELECT service_data.department, SUM(service_data.total_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM service_data
GROUP BY service_data.department
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Client
```sql
SELECT service_data.client_name, SUM(service_data.total_revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM service_data
GROUP BY service_data.client_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Total Hours Worked
```sql
SELECT SUM(hours) AS total_time FROM service_data;
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue FROM service_data;
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Percentage Contribution by Department
```sql
SELECT
    department,
    SUM(total_revenue) AS department_revenue,
    (SUM(total_revenue) / (SELECT SUM(total_revenue) FROM service_data) * 100) AS revenue_percentage
FROM service_data
GROUP BY department;
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Month-on-Month Revenue Increase
```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        FORMAT(service_date, 'yy-MM') AS month,
        SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue
    FROM service_data
    GROUP BY FORMAT(service_date, 'yy-MM')
),
revenue_comparison AS (
    SELECT
        month,
        revenue,
        LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_revenue
    FROM monthly_revenue
)
SELECT
    month,
    previous_month_revenue,
    ((revenue - previous_month_revenue) / previous_month_revenue) * 100 AS revenue_percentage_increase
FROM revenue_comparison
WHERE previous_month_revenue IS NOT NULL;
```

## üìå DAX Measures for Power BI

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(service_data[total_revenue])
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Total Hours Worked
```DAX
Total Hours = SUM(service_data[hours])
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Region
```DAX
Revenue by Region = SUMX(VALUES(branch_data[region]), CALCULATE(SUM(service_data[total_revenue])))
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue by Department
```DAX
Revenue by Department = SUMX(VALUES(service_data[department]), CALCULATE(SUM(service_data[total_revenue])))
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Clients by Revenue
```DAX
Top 5 Clients =
VAR RankedClients =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        SUMMARIZE(service_data, service_data[client_name], "Total Revenue", SUM(service_data[total_revenue])),
        "Rank", RANKX(ALL(service_data[client_name]), [Total Revenue], , DESC)
    )
RETURN
    FILTER(RankedClients, [Rank] <= 5)
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Percentage Contribution by Department
```DAX
Revenue % by Department =
DIVIDE(
    SUM(service_data[total_revenue]),
    CALCULATE(SUM(service_data[total_revenue]), ALL(service_data)),
    0
) * 100
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Month-on-Month Revenue Growth
```DAX
Revenue MoM Growth =
VAR PrevMonthRevenue =
    CALCULATE(SUM(service_data[total_revenue]), DATEADD(service_data[service_date], -1, MONTH))
RETURN
IF(NOT ISBLANK(PrevMonthRevenue), (SUM(service_data[total_revenue]) - PrevMonthRevenue) / PrevMonthRevenue, BLANK())
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Cumulative Revenue (YTD)
```DAX
Cumulative Revenue =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(service_data[total_revenue]),
    DATESYTD(service_data[service_date])
)
```
